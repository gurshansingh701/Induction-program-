# Day1 
(30 july,2025)

### Warm welcome to all students by principal, professors and all college staff.
### Then start the  induction program.
### All students reached the gurdwara Sahib. Kirtan was sung at the Gurdwara Sahib and everyone listened to the Kirtan.The atmosphere was really calming and gave me a positivity. It felt like the right way to begin this new phase of life. Everyone sat quietly and listened to the prayer. It kind of set the tone for the rest of the day â€” peaceful and focused. then all students take tea and snacks.
### we all reached near the auditorium and take our welcome kits.
